# CS202-pa08
This is my programming assignment for CS202


Note: this code is horrible in terms of being DRY, but I am not sure how to create a function without having the size of the array.  You get the size from a separate file and then read it in to use the data.  

Sample file:

1
4
1234
5678
9123
4567
row 1 2

command: ./pa08 < sampleFile
