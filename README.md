# CS202-pa08
This is my programming assignment for CS202


Note: this code is horrible in terms of being DRY, but I am not sure how to create a function without having the size of the array.  You get the size from a separate file and then read it in to use the data.  I will get this going next class, but hopefully I figure it out before then as I might not get the grade I want with this code.
